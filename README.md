# Patterns of Thought

My BSc Thesis on `Patterns of Thought`, a generalization of [Pattern Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_theory), a mathematical algebraic formalism, which was invented by [Prof. Ulf Grenander](https://web.archive.org/web/20090122102751/http://www.dam.brown.edu/pattern/ug.html) to describe knowledge of the world as patterns.

For getting a general idea about `Pattern Theory` and `Patterns of Thought` please see my powerpoint presentations:

+ **PatternTheory-MyPresentation-SISSA-29July08.ppt**: an introduction to Pattern Theory

+ **PatternsofThought-MyPresentation-SISSA-29July08**: an introduction to Patterns of Thought as well as providing a description of Matlab codes in the folder Matlab-UlfGrenander.

The content of other folders:
+ **Matlab-UlfGrenander**: The Matlab scripts

+ **BScThesis**: My BSc Thesis (in Persian)

+ **Tutorials**: futher tutorials on `Pattern Theory` and `Patterns of Thought`
